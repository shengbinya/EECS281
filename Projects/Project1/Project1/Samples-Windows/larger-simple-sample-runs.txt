All of the tests below were run on the complex-dict.txt,
with both change and length mode turned on. All have word
output mode except the last test (which has both word and
morph mode output, and uses the swap flag also).

The times shown below are very dependent upon the hardware,
number of users, compiler flags, etc.  If you're running
inside of Visual Studio or Xcode, you're most likely in a
debug build, which makes a large difference in time.

The output using simple versus complex dictionary can be
different since the complex dictionary produces the words
in a slightly different order.
